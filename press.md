## About OpenHire.

OpenHire is a simple board that let company and open source developers meets.

The platform is extremely simple and totally Open Source, but it is nothing more than a simple static blog on Jekyll.

The project is born out of the frustration of the jobless author for code challenges, he doesn't think that code challenges should be used to decide whenever a developer is able or not.

So he figured out that if company had another way to know the ability of a candidate code challenges shouldn't be necessary anymore.

Since one of the most productive way to code is to contribute to the open source, why don't test the candidate in a real problem, while making the word a little more free ?

This is how the young OpenHire is born.

Companies that are interested in hiring through Open Source can simply put their job on the board.

Developers who looks for a job can see what companies are hiring and what stacks those companies are using, if they are interested it is only a matter to show their abilities.

Developers can show their value contributing to any open source project, but to make thing easier some interesting projects for any languages are highlighted.

Once the developer has finish her contribution the developer and the company will meet online and they will proceed in the hiring process.

The project is definitely slower that the 90 minutes code challenges but it does provide several advantages.

The developer does not have a time limit constrain and it will be more relax, she will work on project she cares about and finally her work will, hopefully, be a great contribution to the community.

The companies will get a lot of useful information from the candidate, not only her ability to write code but also how she communicate with peers, if she completed her work with test and documentation and so forth.
