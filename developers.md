# Developer and Company for Open Source

I made this little page to try to solve an extensive problem.

How companies hire developers and how developers are judge by companies.

## Code Challenges ? We hate those...

Company need to test the quality of future candidate before to hire them.

Usually this is made through code challenges.

Code challenges however do not show how great (or poor) a developer is.

On the other side, also developers do not like code challenges, they put a lot of stress and a lot of developers not performance well under stress.

## Open Source ? We love it !

There is a lot of need of high quality open source contribution, why don't contribute in some open source project to show your next employer your value as developer ?

## Great, which company will hire me ?

We are starting experimenting small with just a couple of companies, you can find the list [here](list_company)

## Those companies are amazing ! What now ?

Any company is looking for some specific knowledge and skill, contribute to some project to show that you got those skill.

## But I don't know what project I should contribute...

Don't worry we have highlight some project that need your help and that are great to show your skill, you can find those projects in the page of the company.

Remember that those project are just suggestions, if you want to contribute to something related that's great to :)

## OK this project looks great, what now ?

Now it is up to you ! Great developer show leadership !

You can close some bug, add some features, refactor some code.

Whatever you like !

## Great I make a pull request, and now ?

Just [email me](my_email) please be sure to include your pull request, for what company you are applying and for what role.

Then I will write you back.

Of course you can also make multiple pull request, it would be extremely appreciate, however there is a little caveat, you need to send a least a pull request made after the job posting.

## I made my pull request but it is been reject by the maintainers of the project :(

Don't worry, there are a tons of reason why pull requests are reject, we don't actually care, we just need to see the quality of your code.

## Another developer fixed my same issues.

Great, it means that such issues was really important, again, we don't care if your pull request is been accepted or not, we just want to see how great you are as developer.

## Cool, where I sign up ?

You don't :)

When you finish your work simply send me an [email](my_email) and you are great.

## I will get hire for sure, right ?

No, definitely no.

A lot of factors are important in the hiring process, you can be the best developer in the world but not a good fit in a particular company.

This is a way to give back to the open source community and have fun, be hired should be see as a nice side effect.
