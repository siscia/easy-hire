## Why I should participate ? My code challenges works great !

Are you sure ?

Don't have much time to complete a fairly difficult test is not easy.

Some (most ?) developers do not work great under much stress.

Most of the time the success in a code challenge is about having already solved something similar.

## OK, maybe code challenges are not perfect, but they works good enough...

Sure but you can get much more from this simple experiment.

You can answer question like:

+ Did the candidate provide test coverage for the pull request ?
+ Did the candidate wrote a single giant commit or a lot of smaller incremental one ?
+ Did the candidate explained what is been done ? Did she explain why ?
+ Are the guidelines of the project been followed ?

## Humm start to be interesting...

And it is completely risk free, [just send me an email][my_email] and I will add you to the [companies page.][company_page]

## Can I suggest open source where to test the candidate ?

Sure, you can *suggest* those project, however if a candidate made a wonderful contribution to some other project I am expecting you to treat her as well as all the other candidate.

## Great, I am now in the companies page, what now ?

As soon as some candidate make a pull request I will scan through such request pretty quickly just to make sure that is not completely garbage, if the pull request is acceptable in quality I will introduce to you the developer.

## Cool, how much it cost ?

For now it is completely free of charge. Enjoy ;-)
