Open Hire is a simple project that aims at changing how companies hire developers.

Instead of being introduced to the company by code challenges, developers are given the possibility to show the value they bring to open source.

In most situation it can be a win / win scenario.

## [Developers][dev]

Developers will have more time and less pressure to show that they can really bring value to the company.

Furthermore the code they will write is going to be useful at the whole community.

## [Companies][com]

Companies will get a real insight in how the candidate works, saving time and resource.
