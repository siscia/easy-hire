Open Hire is a simple project that aims at changing how companies hire developers.

Instead of being introduced to the company by code challenges, developers are given the possibility to show the value they bring to open source.

In most situation it can be a win / win scenario.

## [Developers][dev]

Developers will have more time and less pressure to show that they can really bring value to the company.

Furthermore the code they will write is going to be useful at the whole community.

## [Companies][com]

Companies will get a real insight in how the candidate works, saving time and resource.

## Great ! How do I participate ?

You can simply follow this guide:

+ [Developers][dev]

+ [Companies][com]

## What companies participate ?

We do have 2 different kind of companies, friend and random.

+ Friend are companies that we have talk and discuss with, they agree to put their name on the web site and basically are extremely cool about all this process.

+ Random are companies that we know are hiring, we haven't talk with them and we are not sure how much they like all the process.

Of course you should point to the `friend` companies, but we are extremely young so the most of the companies are `random`.

You can find the list of both kind of companies [here.][company-list]
